		p.animate(speed="0.5" type="from" options="opacity:0,delay:0.5") Through the platform of his nightly cable news show, Blunt is on a mission to impart his wisdom and guidance on how Americans should live, think and behave. Besieged by network bosses, a dysfunctional news staff, numerous ex-wives and children of all ages, Blunt&#8217;s only support is the alcoholic manservant he transplanted from the U.K. to join him in Los Angeles.
